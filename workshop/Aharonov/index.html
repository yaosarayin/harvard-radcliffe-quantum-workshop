Fun to be here, thanks a lot for the invitation. Looking forward to various discussions. Okay, so I’m going to talk about measurements, but I’m not going to talk about the measurement problem. I am going to talk about what are measurements in the world in which we have quantum computers and which we have computational perspective on what we do in physics. This is for me some kind of a culmination or some kind of, I don&#x27;t know, a step, a very important step at the end of a long line of works, which you see below, which actually started at Radcliffe Institute a while ago. It&#x27;s joint work with Jordan Cotler and Xiaoling Qi, and it was just posted a few hours ago on quant-ph, so you&#x27;ll be able to see it tomorrow. So, okay, so what am I talking about? First of all, how it started, just to let you know. About fifteen years ago, in fact more, I visited Radcliffe, which is here, what Jacob said, and I had a very fascinating conversation with two prominent computer scientists, who actually argued with me about why am I so interested in quantum computation. So they basically said, “Well, yes, it&#x27;s very interesting theoretically, but give us one reason to actually believe that quantum mechanics is going to be capable of performing computations that are exponentially stronger than classical mechanics.” And I thought to myself, “Well, just wait a second. I’ll just go to the physics department and give you one, two, three, four examples.” It took me something like ten years, and I don&#x27;t know how long, maybe five years, and a lot of work, to actually realize that there is no answer to what they were asking for. There is no way to use the usual predict and compare paradigm of quantum experiments to actually provide a proof for the exponential advantage of quantum mechanics, of many body quantum mechanics in terms of computational power. And that leads to, actually, a new type of experiment involving interactions, involving structured interactions, in which instead of this usual type of experiment, in which we have an experimentalist here on the right side — and that&#x27;s my theoretical point of view of experimentalists — and a theoretician on the on the left-hand side; and usually what they do is they have some physical theory, and they want to test it, so they initialize the experiment, they initialize the — they compute the predictions of theory, and they compare. That&#x27;s the predict and compare paradigm. But by quantum mechanics, the left-hand side, if we really believe that quantum computers or the quantum evolution is exponentially hard to simulate, we cannot make those predictions. So the left hand side is unavailable to us, and therefore these predict and compare experiments are impossible to do in in our in our realistic world where we only have a polynomial time or a limited amount of time. So we have to think of a new type of experiment, and this is what we did, me and Michael Ben-Or and Elad Eban. And we actually found a new type of experiment involving interactions. And this was the beginning of a long journey for me, of basically asking, “What are the most general experiments that we can conduct in in our world, in our physical world?” And as a computer scientist, as a theoretical computer scientist, I wanted to give an answer using a computational point of view. And this paper I was telling you about is exactly that. So, here is the — if you replace this classical theory by quantum mechanics, this is impossible, and there&#x27;s a problem, but I’ll skip that and I’ll get to introducing what is actually going on in this new type of experiment, or in the most general experiment that we&#x27;re thinking about. And then maybe later I’ll have a little bit of time to go back to this interesting example of this involving interactions. So I would say that these new ideas about experiments are actually penetrating inside physics already for a decade. So if you look at the quantum revolutions that we&#x27;ve been witnessing over the past 25 years or so, or more, there was a revolution in it coming from the invention of quantum algorithms that sort of answers a question, which is, “What is an efficient computation, what is a tractable computation in our world?” There&#x27;s another revolution that came after that, which actually talked about the influence of the invention of quantum algorithms, or the quantum computational model, on the understanding of physics itself, not from the point of view of practical implementations of theoretical ideas of quantum algorithms, but actually trying to understand quantum physics itself from the point of view of computational complexity, or computational point of view. And that leads to basically new understandings on quantum physics as an information process, and there was a whole new field that emerged from this that is called quantum Hamilton complexity, in which ground states and evolutions governed by some Hamiltonians are described by these ideas. Now, the revolution I’m talking about is what I think is still an unrecognized revolution, and that&#x27;s the revolution of, “What is an experiment?” I would say that in the past 10 years there have been new algorithmic ingredients, new computational ingredients that have penetrated quantum experiments in ways which have not been done before. And this is just sort of a grassroot movement, in the sense that it&#x27;s sort of everybody does it on their own, but there&#x27;s no theory around it, and this paper I was telling you about is an attempt to actually plant the seeds for this theory.</p><p>To start explaining this, I there is there is one very important thing that underlies, I think, essentially all these ideas that entered physics from the area of quantum computation, and that&#x27;s the violation of what is called the extended Church-Turing thesis. So, what is the extended Church-Turing thesis? It states that all physically realizable computational models can be efficiently — that is, in polynomial time — simulated by a classical Turing machine, which means that if you have a Turing machine that runs some algorithm by some elementary steps requiring some scaling with the size of the input as some function, then any other computation model can be stimulated with its elementary steps by at most polynomial overhead by this classical Turing machine. So, this complexity, measured according to the Turing machine steps, captures everything that can be done in the physical world. This is great — except if you think that quantum computers will be realized, and if you believe that they will be stronger than classical computers, then this thesis is wrong</p><p>So, let me insert a little bit of jargon. We won&#x27;t actually need it, but just so that we can talk about it now for this slide. Basically, computer scientists talk about two classes of problems: BPP and BQP. BPP is the class of problem solvable in polynomial time by classical computers, bounded probabilistic polynomial time. BQP is the class of problem solvable in polynomial time by quantum computers. Factoring sits in BQP and is strongly believed not to be in BPP. And basically, we can call this this part of BQP that is not inside BPP the “high complexity regime” of quantum mechanics, and the quantum evolutions that are simulatable classically efficiently, those will be quantum evolutions of low complexity. And basically, the people who are trying to realize quantum computers believe that this part in BQP and not in BPP exists, is realizable. So it is widely believed that quantum computation violates the extended Church-Turing thesis, and this basically is composed of two different beliefs: one, a mathematical conjecture that BQP is different than BPP as mathematical entities, and two, basically a physics belief that we can actually realize the model of quantum computation that is BQP in reality. And together, basically it says that quantum computation will violate the extended Church-Turing thesis, and what this leads us to is we need actually to replace the extended Church-Turing thesis by a quantum version. And that quantum version will say that a quantum computer captures everything that can be done in the world physically from the point of view of complexity, of how many elementary steps are needed in order to perform some computational process or some evolution. And so essentially, there&#x27;s no candidate for a counterexample for this. We strongly believe that the quantum extended Church-Turing thesis is indeed true, and this gives a very, very interesting point of view on nature and on quantum physics, because it basically says that different physical systems — very different physical systems, like spin systems, and high energy physics, and what have you — they can actually be connected by looking at their information-processing capabilities and mapping one to another. So, it gives this idea — the quantum extended Church-Turing thesis basically says that if they all if they both exhibit the high-complexity regime of quantum mechanics, they are sort of equivalent. They can be mapped one to each other. And this creates amazing links between very different parts of physics. I think this is extremely fundamental. This is an understanding that emerged from quantum computation of the past 30 years, or 25 years, and it underlies all the new ideas that penetrate into quantum physics. Okay, but now, let&#x27;s go back to experiments. I want to take those ideas and actually use them to look at experiments from a different point of view. Okay, so we&#x27;re going back to these revolutions, and now we&#x27;re going to talk about quantum experiments, but we will view them from that point of view — essentially, as algorithms.</p><p>Okay, and what I want to explain to you a little, if I’ll get to that, is we have, I think, a model that is universal for quantum experiments. Okay, so let me let me just very briefly go through some quantum experiments before I give you the essence of the model. So here&#x27;s an example of a quantum experiment, a very simple one. You have a crystal sample, X-ray photons hitting it and scattering off it, and a camera and computer assessing the information to deduce the molecular structure of the crystal. Great. The new experiments I’m talking about are not of this very common type. There are new experiments in which computational ingredients are involved. So, for example, if you&#x27;re familiar with a Hayden-Preskill gedankenexperiment to study the information paradox using a quantum computer, that would be an experiment that involves a quantum computer being entangled with a black hole. So, that’s a gedankenexperiment.</p><p>JACOB BARANDES: Just a note, Dorit, you have two minutes.</p><p>DORIT AHARONOV: Okay, thanks. However, there are other experiments which were actually implemented, such as quantum error correcting involved in sensing to prolong the time where the signal persists so that the precision is enhanced. There are also other experiments that sort of involve Shor’s algorithm — if you have a quantum computer, to get exponential violations of the time-energy uncertainty principle and measurements. So, all these new ideas, they&#x27;re all very different, have computational components in them, and one is led to ask, “What is a physical experiment? What is a quantum experiment?” And I want to give a computational complexity answer to this, which actually will enable us to talk about new types of quantum experiments, including those that I was talking about in the beginning involving structured interactions and other things. So, the new type was called quantum algorithm measurements, or QUALMS, but it&#x27;s actually experiments — it&#x27;s not the measurement that we&#x27;re talking about with the measurement problem. And what does this model include? Well, if you look at an experiment, there are sort of important ingredients that we have to model. One is that the experiment computes some function given a physical system. It&#x27;s a classical function, but the input is not given to you, you’re just given access to it. And moreover, you&#x27;re not given full access to it, you&#x27;re given some access to some of the degrees of freedom, but not to others: there&#x27;s some degrees of freedom which are hidden. And you have quantum interactions with the degrees of freedom to which you have axis. So, if you look at the crystal example, there&#x27;s sort of three different entities in an experiment. One is the “nature” to which you don&#x27;t have access — we call it “nature,” as this sort of the hidden part of the physical system where we don&#x27;t have access to the hidden degrees of freedom. There&#x27;s the laboratory where we do have access to, and there&#x27;s the workspace where we actually have full control, and there&#x27;s no interaction between the workspace and nature. So our model — and I’ll basically end with that — is some kind of a quantum algorithm which involves interacting with an unknown physical system, involving some superoperator and some initial state and maybe some classical input state, and outputting the classical output of the of the of the experiment after this interaction. And it&#x27;s basically a hybrid of quantum interactive protocols from quantum computers and black box algorithms. And we believe, after sort of trying to describe using this framework many different experiments, that this simple model essentially captures universally all possible experiments, including what I said before and also the experiments that I was referring to at the beginning. Let me just very quickly — okay, I want to skip this — but just to say, using this model, we can test whether various types of experiments actually give you exponential advantage. Surprisingly, coherent versus incoherent experiments, there&#x27;s exponential advantage to it, which is different than the advantage of quantum algorithms. It&#x27;s a new type of exponential advantage, but this is the exponential advantage. But if we go back to this type of experiments that I was talking about in the beginning — of how to actually verify a quantum computer, that it&#x27;s actually acting correctly — well, you need a new type of experiment involving interactions. And this is what we actually managed to do. We actually managed to show that even though you cannot actually predict the results of a quantum system, using structured experiments, you actually are able to verify that it&#x27;s correct. And this is what I would refer to as being able to be convinced of the correctness of something without being able to understand what&#x27;s going on. You just know that it’s correct, but you don&#x27;t know how to explain what&#x27;s going on. There&#x27;s a structured way to actually prove that you get convinced — correctly, justifiably — but you don&#x27;t know why. I have a very funny story about magicians because, due to this interaction, are able to do various things, but I’ll end here, and maybe tell it you to you either later today or tomorrow.</p></div></article><div class="margin-vert--xl"><div class="row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/edit/master/website/workshop/Aharonov.mdx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="1.2em" width="1.2em" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" role="img" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-label="Edit page"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div></div></div><div class="margin-vert--lg"><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/workshop/Kaiser"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">« Tackling Loopholes in Experimental Tests of Bell’s Inequality</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/workshop/Raamsdonk"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Spacetime and Gravity from Quantum Mechanics »</div></a></div></nav></div></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">Workshop</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/workshop/">Getting Started</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">Community</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Twitter</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">More</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/blog">Blog</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2021 Yao Yin.</div></div></div></footer></div>
